LEVERAGING MACHINE LEARNING TO BUILD A DRIVER DROWSINESS DETECTION SYSTEM.
Drowsiness and Fatigue of drivers are amongst the significant causes of road accidents. Every year, they increase the amounts of deaths and fatalities injuries globally. In this paper, a module for Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) is presented to reduce the number of accidents due to drivers fatigue and hence increase the transportation safety; this system deals with automatic driver drowsiness detection based on visual information and Artificial Intelligence. We propose an algorithm to locate, track, and analyse both the drivers face and eyes to measure PERCLOS, a scientifically supported measure of drowsiness associated with slow eye closure.
